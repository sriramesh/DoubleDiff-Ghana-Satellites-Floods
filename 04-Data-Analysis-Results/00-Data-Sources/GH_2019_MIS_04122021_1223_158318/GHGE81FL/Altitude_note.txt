The altitude values listed in the recode files for clusters that are missing GPS coordinates
were calculated by computing the average altitude from the SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) 
DEM (Digital Elevation Model) for the administrative 3 area to which the cluster belongs.


All ALT_DEM locations were extracted except one: Cluster 169. This cluster was classified MIS and had no record of an Admin 2 in several shapefiles that were examined (Cluster 169).
