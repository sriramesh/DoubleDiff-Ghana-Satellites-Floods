# Double difference evaluation of a satellite-based flood information system for the Government of Ghana's National Disaster Risk Management Organization (NADMO)

This repository provides all relevant files for a working paper that sits at the intersection of applied econometrics and climate change. The paper examines whether the provision of a satellite-based flood information system (FIS) to the Government of Ghana's National Disaster Risk Management Organization (NADMO) reduces the number of flood-affected people in high flood risk districts relative to low flood risk ones. This paper also serves as my master's thesis for the Master of Development Practice (MDP) degree at UC Berkeley.
