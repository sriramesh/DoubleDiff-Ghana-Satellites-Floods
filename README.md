# Can satellites help first responders in Ghana improve food security after catastrophic flooding? The foundations of a quasi-experimental impact evaluation


This repository contains all data and analysis for a working paper 'Can satellites help first responders in Ghana improve food security after catastrophic flooding? The foundations of a quasi-experimental impact evaluation'. Using Ghana as a case study, this study lays the framework for the first-ever quasi-experimental impact evaluation to estimate the impact of a satellite-based flood information system (FIS) on food security outcomes. This study serves as my master's thesis for the completion of the Master of Development Practice (MDP) degree at UC Berkeley.
