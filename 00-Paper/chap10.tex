\section{The FIS as a pre-flood early warning platform}

The current quasi-experimental design of the study examines the efficacy of the FIS as a post-flood, aid targeting mechanism. However, NADMO officials that use the FIS have indicated their interest in using the FIS as a principal component of a redesigned internal process in which satellite-based flood information informs long-term flood preparedness. Part of this effort could involve preventative relocation, an increasingly popular climate change adaptation strategy, in which civilians living in floodplains are moved out of the floodplain in order to reduce loss of life.\\

In its current form the FIS has supported NADMO primarily as a post-flood aid targeting platform. In future years of the program, however, if NADMO begins to use the FIS in any pre-flood capacity (for preventative relocation or otherwise), the damage data readily available through satellites could serve as an appropriate outcome variable of interest.
