# Can satellites help first responders in Ghana improve food security after catastrophic flooding? The foundations for a double-difference impact evaluation


This repository contains all data and analysis for a working paper entitled 'Can satellites help first responders in Ghana improve food security after catastrophic flooding? The foundations for a double-difference impact evaluation'. Using Ghana as a case study, this study lays the framework for the first-ever quasi-experimental impact evaluation that attempts to estimate the impact of a satellite-based flood information system (FIS) on district-level food security outcomes. This repo provides all code found in the Data and Methods section of the paper, namely the methodology to 1) develop a composite Flood Risk Index using flood recurrence intervals and flood impact estimates, 2) assign districts to treatment and control groups, and 3) examine treatmetn and control group means for parallel trends. This respository also contains all data used in this paper, including shapefiles of Ghana at the Adm 2 level, flood recurrence intervals, and flood impact estimates across Ghana from the years 1985 - 2020.

This study serves as my master's thesis for the Master of Development Practice (MDP) degree at UC Berkeley.
